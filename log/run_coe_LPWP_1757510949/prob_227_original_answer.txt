```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def prob_227(subsoil, topsoil):
    c = [10, 6]  # Coefficients of the objective function to minimize 10x + 6y
    A = [[10, 6], [0, 1], [-0.3, 0.7]]  # Coefficients of the constraints
    b = [150, 10, 0]  # Right-hand side of the constraints

    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(0, None))

    return int(res.fun)  # Return the minimized amount of water required
```

This code accurately reflects the problem constraints and objective function provided by the experts in modeling, parameter extraction, and programming. It uses linear programming to minimize the total amount of water required to hydrate the garden bed by determining the optimal number of bags of subsoil and topsoil to be bought.
